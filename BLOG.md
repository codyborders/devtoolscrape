## 2025-11-09 - RUM SDK v6 Rollout
Datadog just published browser-sdk v6.23.0, so I started by querying the GitHub releases API to see exactly what changed and to confirm we should be targeting the v6 family instead of the older v5 builds. Once I had the release tag, I hopped onto the prod droplet and rewrote the Datadog nginx module stanza from `datadog_rum_config "v5"` to `"v6"`, then ran `nginx -t` to make sure there were no syntax surprises before reloading the service. The rest of the config (app ID, client token, service/env/version metadata, and the sampling flags) stayed untouched so the browser payload only changed in terms of SDK bits.

After the reload I spot-checked the public site with `curl -sk https://devtoolscrape.com | grep datadoghq-browser-agent` and saw the script now streams from `www.datadoghq-browser-agent.com/us1/v6/datadog-rum.js`, which confirms nginx is injecting the v6 drop-in. Because the Datadog module handles cache busting internally, we don’t have to worry about stale assets, and I logged the whole swap in `PROGRESS.md` so the next person knows why we jumped majors.
