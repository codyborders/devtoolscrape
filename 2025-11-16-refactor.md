# Dependency Opportunities – 2025-11-16

- ai_classifier.py: Replace the handwritten TTLCache/locking logic with `cachetools.TTLCache` (or similar) and switch `_call_openai` to a decorator-based retry helper like `tenacity`/`backoff` so batch classification code shrinks and policies stay declarative.
- database.py: Introduce an ORM or lightweight query builder (SQLAlchemy, SQLModel, or peewee) to express the schema and filters once; will eliminate the many raw SQL strings plus manual dict conversions.
- app_production.py: Adopt a pagination helper (Flask-Paginate, paginate, etc.) so all routes share one paginator instead of recomputing per-page/page/offset math and range displays manually.
- logging_config.py: Swap the custom structured-logging stack for a library such as structlog or loguru (with Datadog processors) to retire the bespoke formatter, context filter, and handler wiring while keeping JSON + correlation support.
